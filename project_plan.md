# SwiftSearch Project Plan

## Overview
SwiftSearch is a high-performance, privacy-focused local file search engine built in Swift. It provides fast, accurate search capabilities while ensuring all data remains on the user's device.

## Core Modules

### 1. Indexing Module
The indexing system is responsible for creating and maintaining a searchable index of files.

#### Key Components:
- File System Watcher
  - Monitors file system changes in real-time
  - Triggers incremental index updates
- Content Extractor
  - Supports various file formats (text, PDF, etc.)
  - Extracts metadata and content for indexing
- Index Manager
  - Manages SQLite database for storing file metadata
  - Handles incremental updates efficiently
  - Implements folder exclusion logic

#### Performance Considerations:
- Batch processing for large directory scans
- Efficient delta updates for changed files
- Memory-conscious content extraction
- Background processing to avoid UI blocking

### 2. Search Engine Module
The core search functionality that processes queries and returns relevant results.

#### Key Components:
- Query Parser
  - Supports Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
  - Handles regex patterns
  - Processes date/size filters
- Search Executor
  - Optimizes query execution plans
  - Implements efficient SQLite queries
  - Handles result ranking and scoring
- Result Manager
  - Manages result pagination
  - Handles sorting and filtering
  - Provides preview data generation

#### Performance Goals:
- Sub-second query response time
- Efficient memory usage for large result sets
- Smart caching of frequent queries
- Asynchronous preview generation

### 3. UI Module
The SwiftUI-based user interface providing a modern, accessible search experience.

#### Key Components:
- Search Interface
  - Clean, intuitive search bar
  - Real-time search suggestions
  - Advanced query builder
- Results View
  - Grid/list view toggle
  - File previews
  - Batch action support
- Preferences Panel
  - Index configuration
  - Search preferences
  - Folder exclusion management

#### Design Principles:
- Accessibility first (VoiceOver support)
- Responsive layout
- Dark mode support
- Clear visual feedback

### 4. Security & Privacy Module
Ensures user data protection and privacy-focused design.

#### Key Components:
- Local Storage
  - All data stays on device
  - Optional database encryption
  - Secure temporary file handling
- Access Control
  - Optional TouchID/FaceID integration
  - Folder-level access restrictions
  - Audit logging (optional)

#### Privacy Guarantees:
- Zero telemetry collection
- No external API dependencies
- No cloud sync or sharing features
- Complete data isolation

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Basic file indexing
- Simple search interface
- Local storage implementation

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Advanced query support
- UI improvements
- Batch actions

### Phase 3: Polish & Performance
- Security features
- Performance optimizations
- Extended file format support

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Core indexing logic
- Search algorithm accuracy
- Query parser functionality

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end search flows
- UI interaction testing
- Performance benchmarks

### Performance Tests
- Large directory indexing
- Complex query execution
- Memory usage monitoring

## Known Constraints

1. Local Processing Only
   - All indexing and search operations must remain on device
   - No cloud backup or sync features
   - No external API calls or data transmission

2. Resource Usage
   - Careful memory management for large indexes
   - Background processing for intensive operations
   - Disk space considerations for index storage

3. File Format Support
   - Initial focus on common text formats
   - Gradual expansion to binary formats
   - Performance trade-offs for complex formats

## Success Metrics

1. Performance
   - Sub-second search response time
   - Minimal impact on system resources
   - Smooth UI interactions

2. User Experience
   - Intuitive interface
   - Reliable search results
   - Stable operation

3. Privacy
   - Zero data leakage
   - Complete local operation
   - Transparent security model
